        <b>Fenugreek seeds </b> is an herb that is similar to clover. It is native to the Mediterranean region, southern Europe and western Asia.
        The seeds are used in cooking, in medicine, and to hide the taste of other medicine.
        Fenugreek seeds smell and taste similar to maple syrup. Fenugreek leaves are eaten in India as a vegetable.<br>
        Fenugreek is taken by mouth for diabetes, menstrual cramps, high cholesterol, and many other conditions,
        but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.
